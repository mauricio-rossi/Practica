## 🎯 Story Goal
As a developer, I want to create a GitHub Kanban Project to track both story and non-story work, so that progress can be visualized and managed efficiently across sprints.  
*(Original: [US-00006](../../../shared/user-stories/US-00006.md))*

## ✅ Validation Summary
| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| A GitHub Project (Kanban) board is created for tracking stories and tasks | ✅ Met | Created two separate Projects for cleaner separation of work |
| Columns include: Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done | ✅ Met | Implemented identical core columns in both boards |
| Each story (US-00001–US-00006) represented as a GitHub Issue linked to its branch and PR | ✅ Met | Verified linkage via branch + PR keywords (`Closes #ID`) |
| Issue naming convention `US-XXXXX: <short description>` followed | ✅ Met | Applied across all initial issues |
| Documentation in `docs/shared/agile-methodologies.md` updated | ✅ Met | Added “Kanban Structure & Automation” section |
| A sample issue created to verify automation linkage | ✅ Met | Confirmed movement from Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done automatically |

## 📊 Delivery Notes
- Created **two GitHub Projects**:  
  - `Practica – Sprint Board` → For **user stories only**, cleaned each sprint.  
  - `Practica – Technical Backlog` → For **non-story issues**, using Table + Board views.
- Implemented consistent status columns (`Backlog`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`) across both.
- Added lightweight automation for:
  - Moving issues to *In Review* when PRs are opened.
  - Closing issues and moving to *Done* when PRs are merged.
- Verified naming convention consistency across all branches and issues.
- Documented the workflow in the shared methodology guide.
- Expanded scope slightly beyond the original story by introducing a **dual-board system** (Stories vs Non-Stories) for improved clarity and sprint hygiene.
