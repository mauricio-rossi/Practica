NO-STORY: Add backlog index README scaffold

## ‚úÖ What Went Well
- Successfully added a central backlog index (`docs/shared/user-stories/README.md`).
- Table structure is clear and easy to update with priorities and statuses.
- Having the status legend will help keep consistency in later updates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Be Improved
- This artifact was discovered mid-sprint rather than planned, which shows gaps in initial story definition.
- Could have included backlog index creation as part of US-00002 (documentation scaffold).

## üîÅ Action Items
- Always confirm that **all key Agile artifacts** (backlog, story index, sprint docs) are included in the scope of planning stories.
- Build a quick checklist for Sprint 1 planning to ensure new artifact needs are identified early.
- Standardize on 5-digit IDs and update any references in backlog index once the ID renaming is complete.
