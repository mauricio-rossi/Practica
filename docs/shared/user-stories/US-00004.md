# US-0004 â€“ Basic CI for Testing

**Persona:** Developer  

**Description:**  
As a developer, I want to set up basic CI for testing so that errors are caught automatically on every push.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- GitHub Actions workflow exists under `.github/workflows/`  
- On push, CI runs at least `npm install` and `npm test` (stubbed if needed)  
- Failed builds block merge until fixed  
- CI setup documented in `docs/shared/ci-cd.md`
