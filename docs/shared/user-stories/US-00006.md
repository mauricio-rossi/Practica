# US-00006: GitHub Kanban Board Setup

**Persona:** Developer  

---

## 🧩 Description
As a developer, I want to deploy a working build to Netlify so early testers can access it without installation.

---

## 💡 Context

This story **emerged organically** during Sprint 0 when project documentation and branching workflows were established.  
A need was identified to **create a central, visual way to track progress** for both user stories and non-story work through GitHub Issues and a Kanban Project board.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A **GitHub Project (Kanban)** board is created for tracking user stories and non-story tasks.  
- Columns include: *Backlog*, *In Progress*, *In Review*, and *Done*.  
- Each story (US-00001 – US-00006) is represented as a GitHub **Issue**, linked to its branch and PR.  
- Issue naming convention:  
  `US-XXXXX: <short description>`  
- Documentation in `docs/shared/agile-methodologies.md` explains how issues and board automation work.  
- A sample issue is created to verify workflow linkage.
