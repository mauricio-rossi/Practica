## üåê Deployment Strategy

### Web (Progressive Web App)
- **Platform**: Firebase Hosting
- **Purpose**: Simulate a mobile app via browser for testing and public access
- **Capabilities**:
  - Add to home screen
  - Offline support (planned)
  - No install required
- **Free Tier**:
  - 1 GB storage
  - 10 GB bandwidth/month
- **Paid Tier**:
  - $0.026/GB storage
  - $0.15/GB bandwidth

### Android
- **Platform**: Expo EAS Build ‚Üí Google Play
- **Process**:
  - Build via `eas build -p android`
  - Output: `.aab` or `.apk`
- **Free Tier**: Unlimited local builds
- **Paid Tier (EAS)**: $0/month (basic), $29/month+ for cloud builds and CI/CD features

### iOS
- **Platform**: Expo EAS Build ‚Üí App Store
- **Process**:
  - Build via `eas build -p ios`
  - Submit with EAS Submit or TestFlight
- **Requirements**:
  - Apple Developer Account: $99/year
  - CI/CD or access to a Mac
- **EAS Free Tier**: Limited builds, no custom build profiles
- **Paid Tier**: $29/month+ for custom workflow, GitHub CI/CD

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend Services

### Firebase (Primary)
- **Authentication**: Email/password and third-party support
- **Firestore**: Scalable NoSQL database (real-time)
- **Storage**: For optional audio/image files
- **Free Tier**:
  - 10K Auths/month
  - 50K reads/day (Firestore)
  - 1 GB storage
- **Blaze Tier (pay-as-you-go)**:
  - $0.18/100K reads
  - $0.026/GB storage
  - $0.12/GB bandwidth

---

## üì± Progressive Web App (PWA) Considerations

- Built using Expo + React Native Web
- Tested in browser, simulates a native app
- Ideal for pre-release testers on mobile without needing app stores
- Installable directly from browser (Add to Home Screen)
- Offline capabilities planned using Service Workers

---

## üß™ Agile Value Alignment

- **Web-first** testing ensures rapid feedback and iteration
- **Cross-platform stack** reduces duplication and future migration costs
- **Firebase** enables quick user auth and data storage without backend engineering overhead
- **EAS** provides consistent deployment paths, including beta testing and internal distribution

---

## üîÆ Future Considerations

- Transition to Supabase if SQL-style data structures or custom API control become necessary
- Add CI/CD for automated testing and release flows
- Consider React Router or Next.js if the web interface becomes more content-driven
