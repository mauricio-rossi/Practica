# CI/CD – Practica App 

## 🎯 Goals
- Keep `main` always releasable.
- Give fast feedback on changes (tests/lint/build).
- Share preview links for quick tester feedback.
- Create reliable “snapshots” of each sprint.

## 🧭 Desired Flow (when implemented)

[ Push / PR to GitHub ]
⬇
[ CI: Lint + Unit/Component Tests + Build check ]
⬇
[ PR Previews for testers (staging URL) ]
⬇
[ Merge to main → Auto deploy to production ]
⬇
[ Tag sprint (sprint-XX-complete) → snapshot kept ]

## 🧱 Scope & Principles
- **Scope (initial):** web build only; native builds optional later.
- **Keep it simple first:** lint, minimal tests, build check.
- **Protect main:** squash-merge only; CI must pass.
- **Immutable snapshots:** tag each sprint (e.g., `sprint-01-complete`).
- **Secrets:** stored in repo secrets (when CD is added).

## 🪜 Phased Rollout (future sprints)
- **Phase 1 (Basic CI):** lint + unit tests + build check on PRs/pushes.
- **Phase 2 (Previews):** auto deploy PR previews (staging URL).
- **Phase 3 (Prod Deploy):** auto deploy on merge to `main`.
- **Phase 4 (Optional Native):** trigger Expo EAS builds from tags.

## 🔍 Quality Gates (once active)
- CI must pass before merge.
- P0/P1 bugs must be closed before tagging a sprint complete.
- Each completed story links to a preview or production URL in its acceptance notes.

## 🧩 Artifacts & Traceability
- **Sprint tags:** `sprint-XX-complete` act as rollback points.
- **PR previews:** linked in PRs and sprint docs for testers.
- **Production URL:** referenced in sprint overviews and completed stories.

## 🚧 Risks & Mitigations
- **Build failures:** keep CI fast and minimal at first; fail early.
- **Flaky tests:** start with a few stable tests; grow gradually.
- **Secret handling:** no secrets in code; store in repo secrets when CD arrives.

## 📝 Where this shows up in docs
- `sprints/sprint-XX/sprint-overview.md`: links to PR previews / prod URL.
- `sprints/sprint-XX/completed-stories/US-XXXX.md`: acceptance evidence includes preview/prod link when available.
- `sprints/sprint-XX/retrospective.md`: note CI/CD wins/issues.
