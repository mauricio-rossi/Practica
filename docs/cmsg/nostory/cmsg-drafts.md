NO-STORY: add cmsg drafts folder and retro notes system

Motivation:
- Needed a structured way to draft commit messages per branch.
- Supports Agile documentation trail and keeps commits consistent.

Scope:
- Added `docs/cmsg/` folder to hold commit message drafts.
- Added `docs/cmsg/retro_notes/` with sprint subfolders for per-branch notes.
- No product code changed.

Notes:
- Logged as unplanned work (NO-STORY) in Sprint 0 retrospective.
- Will help future sprints stay consistent and easier to wrap up.
