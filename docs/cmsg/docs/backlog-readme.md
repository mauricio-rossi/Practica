NO-STORY: Add backlog index README scaffold

## Description
- Created `docs/shared/user-stories/README.md` as the central backlog index.
- Added table with Sprint 0 user stories (US-00001 to US-00005).
- Included status column to track progress (currently marked as In Progress).
- Added status legend for clarity.

## Rationale
Backlog index provides a single source of truth for all user stories.  
This improves transparency, avoids duplication across sprint docs, and ensures traceability.

## Scope
- Added new file: `docs/shared/user-stories/README.md`.
- Populated table with Sprint 0 planned stories.
- Linked to individual story files for future reference.

## Impact
- Backlog index will be updated at the end of each sprint to reflect completed or re-prioritized stories.
- All future user stories must be added here when created.
