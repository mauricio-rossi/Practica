docs: add emergent story US-00006 to backlog

## Description
Added a new user story file `US-00006.md` under `/docs/backlog/` to document the emergent story identified during Sprint 0.  
This establishes traceability and prepares the story for future implementation.

## Rationale
During Sprint 0, a need emerged for a GitHub Kanban board to manage and visualize ongoing work.  
To formalize this as part of the Agile process, the story was documented and added to the backlog for future prioritization and execution.

## Scope
- Added `docs/backlog/US-00006.md` with Persona, Description, Context, Acceptance Criteria, and References  
- Updated `sprint-0/retro-notes.md` to reference the emergent story  
- Followed established file and naming conventions (5-digit ID format, Markdown structure)

## Impact
- Ensures emergent story US-00006 is captured and visible in the backlog  
- Improves transparency and continuity between sprint retrospectives and the backlog  
- Strengthens documentation discipline for future emergent story tracking
